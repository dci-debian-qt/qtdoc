  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * Properly clean the build. Thanks Dmitry Shachnev!
  * Bump qttools' build dependencies to 5.2.0-7~ to ensure we are building
    against the version that reintroduced the documentation.
  * Add qtwebkit5-examples-doc[-html], qtx11extras-doc[-html] and
    qtserialport-doc[-html] as build dependencies and as dependencies of the
    respective packages.
  * Add qtbase5-doc-html as build dependency and as a dependency of the
    respective package. We will add qtbase5-doc as soon as it gets trough
    the NEW queue.

  [ Dmitry Shachnev ]
  * Drop the dh_compress hack, it no longer works now that xz
    is the default compression.
  * Stop exporting versions in debian/rules, the package builds
    fine without that.
  * Drop --list-missing dh option, we already dh_install with
    --fail-missing.
  * Bump required package versions to 5.2.0.
  * Use canonical Vcs-Browser field.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5, no changes needed.
